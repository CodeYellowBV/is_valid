# Installation

Is Valid requires Python 3.4+. You can then easily install it by running
```
pip install is-valid
```
to get the latest release.

If you want to install head for some reason you can also use
```
pip install git+https://github.com/daanvdk/is_valid.git
```
Note that since Is Valid is still in beta (Version 0.x) it will still change
a lot so keep a close eye on the changelog when using it.
