# Introduction
'Is Valid' is a simple lightweight python library for validation predicates.
Predicates are functions that given a certain input return either `True` or
`False` according to some rules that the input either follows or does not
follow.

Is Valid's provides helpful abstractions to easily create these predicates for
common patterns in complex data structures. It also can give you detailed
information about why a certain predicate holds or not for some given data.
